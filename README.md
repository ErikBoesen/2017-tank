# Noboty Practice Bot Code

> Code for the 2018 practice bot

## Noboty?
Noboty is a play on words from Team 118's Everybot. We called it this because noboty will use it.

## Controls
We used a one-joystick control system for sake of convenience. Moving the joystick on the Y axis moves the robot forwards or backwards, and the X axis causes it to rotate.

#### Correcting Joystick Axis
The joystick we used is unique in that the origin, (0,0), is the bottom right of the joystick, rather than the center. To account for this, we had to make some corrections to the joystick input.

#### Sarah mode
This mode cuts the speed of the robot in half, for precision movement in confined areas as well as a simple safety precaution for inexperienced drivers. Sarah mode was created when Sarah, a member of our team, smashed the robot into a wall at full speed. It is activated by pressing the red button on the joystick.
